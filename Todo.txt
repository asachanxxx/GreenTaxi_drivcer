TODO
----
*. when we driver accept the ride it is in the Accept Ride status. so the driver will be arriving to customer location
   so we need to show that driver will be arriving to him in customer app
*  when trip start the pointer needs to move with location update in customer app 
*. Change Icons of the Side bar accordingly
*. In customer app when we browse we need a pointer in middle of the app. 
   if customer stops somewhere we need to aqure that location 
*. Pickup text box in main also need location search. cus customer may be booking for someone else
*. Favorite Places and TRIPS
	- There will be a option on location searchi called Favorite Places. when customer click it then goes to separate page witch will let cusotmer to add and select 
	  either destination  or Starting location from a facorite list 
	- Also there will be a option in side bar called favorite Trips. in thire customer can add or delete his favorite trips.
          and if customer clicks one of them then it will be directed to request tip page directly
          (OR WE CAN add landing page like pickme then add some option to show this )
